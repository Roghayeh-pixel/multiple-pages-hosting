    ü•ê croissant
   </h1> 
   <p>
    A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of
    the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named
    for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession,
    then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
    similar to a puff pastry.
    
    Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.[2]
    Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The modern croissant was developed in
    the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated
    dough.
